This post provides a transparent overview of iTowns governance for organizational stakeholders evaluating the framework's long-term sustainability and decision-making structure.

## iTowns Governance Model

iTowns operates as a **commons**, meaning:

- The framework is collectively owned by its community of users and contributors
- No single organization controls the roadmap or decision-making
- Sustainability comes from collective investment, not venture capital

This model directly addresses concerns about vendor lock-in and project abandonment that plague many open-source projects.

## Decision-Making Structure

### Technical Decisions

Technical decisions (features, APIs, architecture) follow an RFC (Request for Comments) process:

1. **Proposal** — Anyone can submit an RFC via GitHub
2. **Discussion** — Minimum 7-day community discussion period
3. **Review** — Core maintainers assess technical feasibility
4. **Decision** — Consensus-based, with fallback to maintainer vote

**Recent change**: We've extended the discussion period from 5 to 7 days to allow more international participation.

### Strategic Decisions

Strategic decisions (governance changes, partnerships, funding) follow a more formal process:

1. **Proposal** — Submitted to governance board
2. **Community consultation** — Minimum 14-day public discussion
3. **Board recommendation** — Published rationale
4. **Community vote** — For major changes (>50% approval required)

## 2025 Decision Summary

In 2025, the governance board made 12 strategic decisions:

| Decision | Type | Outcome |
|----------|------|---------|
| Extended maintainer team | Membership | Approved |
| Funding allocation model | Funding | Approved |
| Partnership criteria | Process | Approved with amendments |
| Roadmap prioritization | Strategic | Community vote |

All decision records are available in the [governance documentation](/governance).

## Sustainability Model

iTowns is sustained through:

- **Organizational contributions** — Direct funding from organizations using iTowns
- **In-kind contributions** — Developer time, infrastructure, documentation
- **Foundation support** — Grants from open-source foundations

This diversified model reduces single-point-of-failure risk common in corporate-backed open source.

## For Decision-Makers

When evaluating iTowns, consider:

✅ **No vendor lock-in** — Commons ownership means no single point of control  
✅ **Transparent governance** — All decisions and rationale are public  
✅ **Sustainable model** — Diversified funding, not dependent on one organization  
✅ **Active community** — Decisions are made collectively, not unilaterally

## Getting Involved

Organizations can participate in governance through:

- **Community membership** — Participate in discussions and votes
- **Contributing member** — Financial or in-kind support
- **Governance board** — For significant contributors
