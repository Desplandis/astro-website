We're excited to launch the redesigned iTowns website, built from the ground up to serve our community with clarity, transparency, and technical credibility.

## Why a New Website?

The previous website served us well, but as iTowns has matured as a commons-governed framework, we recognized the need for a digital presence that:

- **Serves two audiences equally** — developers evaluating technical fit and decision-makers assessing strategic value
- **Communicates governance transparently** — making our decision-making process visible and understandable
- **Prioritizes content over marketing** — factual, honest information without the hype

## What's New

### Content-First Architecture

The new site is built with Astro, a modern static site generator that prioritizes content. All pages are statically generated for optimal performance—no JavaScript required for reading.

### First-Class Blog

This blog isn't a marketing afterthought. It's a first-class communication channel for:

- Framework evolution updates
- Governance decisions and rationale
- Technical deep-dives
- Community announcements

Every post clearly indicates its intended audience, so you can quickly find content relevant to you.

### Transparent Governance

The [governance section](/governance) now clearly documents:

- How decisions are made
- Who participates in decision-making
- How you can get involved

### Case Studies

Real-world [case studies](/case-studies) demonstrate iTowns in production, with honest assessments of what worked and what we learned.

## What's Next

This launch is just the beginning. Over the coming months, we'll be adding:

- Comprehensive documentation overhaul
- Interactive examples
- More case studies from the community
- Regular technical and governance updates

## Get Involved

The website itself is open source. Found a typo? Want to contribute a case study? We welcome contributions from the community.
